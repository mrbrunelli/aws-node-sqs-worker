# Serverless Framework Node SQS Producer-Consumer on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple SQS-based producer-consumer service running on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework and the [Lift](https://github.com/getlift/lift) plugin. It allows to accept messages, for which computation might be time or resource intensive, and offload their processing to an asynchronous background process for a faster and more resilient system.

## Anatomy of the template

This template defines one function `producer` and one Lift construct - `jobs`. The producer function is triggered by `http` event type, accepts JSON payloads and sends it to a SQS queue for asynchronous processing. The SQS queue is created by the `jobs` queue construct of the Lift plugin. The queue is set up with a "dead-letter queue" (to receive failed messages) and a `worker` Lambda function that processes the SQS messages.

To learn more:

- about `http` event configuration options, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/)
- about the `queue` construct, refer to [the `queue` documentation in Lift](https://github.com/getlift/lift/blob/master/docs/queue.md)
- about the Lift plugin in general, refer to [the Lift project](https://github.com/getlift/lift)
- about SQS processing with AWS Lambda, please refer to the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html)

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard, which includes advanced features such as CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

In order to deploy with dashboard, you need to first login with:

```
serverless login
```

and then perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Excluding development dependencies...
Serverless: Creating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack create progress...
........
Serverless: Stack create finished...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading artifacts...
Serverless: Uploading service aws-node-sqs-worker.zip file to S3 (21.45 MB)...
Serverless: Validating template...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...
................................................
Serverless: Stack update finished...

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can now call the created API endpoint with `POST` request to invoke `producer` function:

```bash
curl --request POST 'https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/produce' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"name": "John"}'
```

In response, you should see output similar to:

```bash
{"message": "Message accepted!"}
```
